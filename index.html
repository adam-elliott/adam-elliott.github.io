<h1>Summon Your Courage</h1>
<p>
    Anything that gives us a sense of safety, whether through stability, familiarity, or acceptance can give us a feeling of “home.” The more secure we feel in these areas the more we have the confidence to take risks and explore life. In turn, a boost in our confidence gives us endurance we would not have otherwise, allowing us to expand our horizons. This idea of “home” is the underlying concept for “Summon Your Courage.” 
<br><br>
Your character starts at his home. When he leaves home, his courage starts to dwindle. This is seen by meter on the top of the the screen. The longer you are away from home the more confidence you lose. Returning to home allows you to fully restore your confidence. Once you have lost all your confidence, a dark wall of fear starts to enter your world. As it moves across your screen you have to get back to your home before it gets to you, or the game ends and you lose. To win the game you must collect and bring home the item of each of the three experiences in the game.
<br><br>
Leaving your home gives you the opportunity to have experiences that permanently grow your confidence. Collecting these experiences will put that item in your bag list at the bottom of your screen. The the effects of the experience is activated until you bring the item received back to your home. Upon reaching home, the item icon will move from your bag list to your home list and the benefit of the experience will be applied by increasing your courage by 10% for the rest of your game. This will give you the ability to explore a little father from home than you could before. 
<br><br>
The second way to increase your confidence is through collecting booster items you find along your way that boast your confidence with a one time burst. These are items are skinned with things that you would need to to reach the experiences, i.e. your homework may be needed to reach your school) Another type of booster item would be a telephone The concept being that talking to your friends and family can booth your confidence.
<br><br>
Thanks for checking out our game and we hope you can boost your confidence in both this game and in your life!
